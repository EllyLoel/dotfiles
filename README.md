# Elly's dotfiles

I've known about dotfiles for a long time but never taken the time to actually pull them all together in a git repo, until now! (_2023/01/22_)

To help give me the push I needed to do it, I followed the course at [dotfiles.eieio.xyz](http://dotfiles.eieio.xyz), I'd recommend it if you're also stuggling to take the plunge.

## Installation

1. `xcode-select --install` (Command Line Tools are required for Git and Homebrew)
2. `git clone https://github.com/ellyloel/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`. We'll start with `https` but switch to `ssh` after everything is installed.
3. `cd ~/.dotfiles`
4. Do a software audit by editing [Brewfile](Brewfile) directly.
5. [`./install`](install)
6. Restart computer.
7. [Generate ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), [add to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account), and switch remotes.
